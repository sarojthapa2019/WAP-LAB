		<h1>Welcome to mumstudents.org!</h1>
		<p>If you're reading this you are probably either an <a href="http://mum.edu/">MUM</a> student in a class that uses this machine -- or someone related to a student interested in seeing their work.</p>

		<p>If you know the username of the person whose home page you want to see, you can go there by putting a ~ in front of their username on the URL bar. For example <a href="http://mumstudents.org/~kdaley">http://mumstudents.org/~kadely</a> leads to Professor Daley's page.</p>

		<p>Course materials are sometimes also hosted on this machine. For example: <a href="http://mumstudents.org/cs472">http://mumstudents.org/cs472</a> takes you to the course material for CS 472.</p>
